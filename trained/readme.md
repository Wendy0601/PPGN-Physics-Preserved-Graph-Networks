# This folder includes the pre-trained models:
(1) "sup_*.pkl" are the PPGN models for different types of faults with various label rates.
(2) "GCN_*.pkl" are the graph convolutional network (GCN) baselines for different types of faults with various label rates.
(3) "CNN_*.pkl" are the convolutional neural networks (CNN) baselines for different types of faults with various label rates.
(4) "NN_*.pkl" are the fully connected neural networks (NN) baselines for different types of faults with various label rates.
